new:
- drivers are abstracted
- array of drivers (more drivers can be added to this array later)
- mouse and keyboards are derived from these drivers
- it's not a good idea to have kb driver print the keyset print directly to screen	-
	* this wont help if we put a graphics mode in between 
		and want to have a desktop
	* keys are in a part of memory where you dont see them
